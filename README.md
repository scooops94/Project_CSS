# Project_CSS

The purpose of this project was to analyze US employment in 4 job categories. We wanted to understand the breakdown of these categories by demographics such as gender and geographic location(state).

As we continued to analyze, we decided to look further into popular subcategories for the states where that category was popular. 

To do this, we pulled Census Api Data for the following Categories:

* Manufacturing
* IT
* Finance
* Social Work

As we continued analyizing, we decided to also look at the breakdown of subcategories for each of the top categories above.

The subcategories we look at were:
* Manufacturing
  *Textile
  *Paper
  *Food
  *Petroleum and Coal
  
* IT
  *Computer and Math
  *Information Research Scientist
  *Developers and Programmers
  *DBA
  
* Finance
  *Audit Clerk
  *Specialist
  *Finance Manager
* Social Work
  *Psychiatric
  *Religious
  *Counselers
  *Child Care
